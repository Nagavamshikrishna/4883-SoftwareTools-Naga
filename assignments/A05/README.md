## A05: Family Tree generation using Graphviz.

### Naga Vamshi Krishn Jammalamadaka

Description:
Create a dot file using python. Used a CSV file to read the data. The dot file generated will help in generating the family tree. lso, divided the the family on generation bases.

##  Files

|   #   | File |  Description |
| :---: | ----------- | ---------------------- |
|    01  |  [family_data.csv](https://github.com/Nagavamshikrishna/4883-SoftwareTools-Naga/blob/main/assignments/A05/family_data.csv)| CSV input data|  
|    02  |  [family_tree.dot](https://github.com/Nagavamshikrishna/4883-SoftwareTools-Naga/blob/main/assignments/A05/family_tree.dot)|dot file generated from pyhton code| 
|    03 |  [family_tree.png](https://github.com/Nagavamshikrishna/4883-SoftwareTools-Naga/tree/main/assignments/A05/family_tree.png)| Output of grahviz code| 
|    04 |  [main.py](https://github.com/Nagavamshikrishna/4883-SoftwareTools-Naga/blob/main/assignments/A05/main.py)| python file to create dot file| 



Design Patterns:
1. circle: Gven the circle shape for the women
2. square: Gven the square shape for the men

Color patterns:
Used different colors for different clans used in the CSV file.

Requirements:
1. Python
2. Graphviz

Usage: 
In the first step created the csv random data. After generating the file, created a python script which will help in generating the dot. copied the dot file code and used graphviz to visualise the family tree.
